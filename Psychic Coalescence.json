				"You will your psychic energy into physical form, conjuring in your hand three gemstones filled with psionic energy. You or someone else can make a ranged spell attack with one of the gemstones by throwing it or hurling it with a {@item sling|phb}. If thrown, a gemstone has a range of 60 feet. If someone else attacks with a gemstone, that attacker adds your spellcasting ability modifier, not the attacker's, to the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes piercing damage equal to {@damage 1d6} + your spellcasting ability modifier. Whether the attack hits or misses, the spell effect then ends on that gemstone and it disappears.",
